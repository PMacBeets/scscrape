# scscrape
A hobby project with the grand aim of improving trade selections in fantasy football. The project is unfinished.
The purpose was as follows:
 - Scrape statisics from website with acess to AFL and Supercoach statistics (footywire.com) and load them automatically 
    into a database.
 - Acess this database while taking into account naive predicitions and use search algorithms to optimise trade choices
 
 Many functionalitys have been lost due to deletion. These include,
 - Jupyter Notebook functionality to manipulate dataset, conduct trade searches and complete trades.
